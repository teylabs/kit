# Media

The kit's media pattern is a library (`Tey\Kit\Media`) that a client app adopts instead of writing its own. It sits on Media Library and adds direct-to-bucket uploads. Conversions, delivery and adopting existing objects come in later slices.

## Setup

Create the upload ledger in one of the app's own migrations:

```php
use Tey\Kit\Media\MediaUploads;

Schema::create(MediaUploads::table(), MediaUploads::schema(...)); // `kit.media.uploads_table`, default kit_media_uploads
```

Point Media Library at the kit's path generator and file remover (`config/media-library.php`):

```php
'path_generator' => Tey\Kit\Media\KeyPathGenerator::class,
'file_remover_class' => Tey\Kit\Media\KeptFileRemover::class,
```

Both leave ordinary Media items alone. They only change how items over an existing key behave.

## Rules

Each collection declares a `MediaRules`: the disk, a key prefix under the app's own, the accepted types (MIME => extension), the largest size, and the presign TTL.

```php
$rules = new MediaRules(disk: 's3', prefix: 'app/slides', types: ['image/png' => 'png', 'image/webp' => 'webp'], maxBytes: 20_000_000);
```

Keys are content-addressed: `<prefix>/<sha[0..2]>/<sha256>.<ext>`.

## Uploading

An upload takes three steps. Each step is a plain operation, so a controller, an MCP tool or a job can call it. **Authorization is the caller's job:** run the policy check before step one.

1. **Request:** `RequestUpload::run($scope, $rules, $mime, $bytes, $sha256, $mutationId)`.
   - It checks the declaration against the rules (a `ValidationException` for `mime`, `bytes` or `sha256`) and reserves a pending `MediaUpload`. It returns an `UploadTicket` (`toArray()` for JSON or MCP), whose method tells the client what to do next:
     - `PUT`: a presigned URL. The signature binds `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `x-amz-checksum-sha256` and `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, so the bucket refuses any other body. Send exactly `headers`.
     - `POST`: the disk can't presign (a local disk). Send the file as multipart to the app's own route, which calls step 3 with the file.
     - `null`: the same content is already ready in this scope (dedupe). Go straight to step 3.
   - Replaying the same `mutationId` with the same declaration returns the same record with a fresh URL. A different declaration is refused (`media.upload.mutation_conflict`).
2. **PUT:** the client sends the body straight to the bucket.
3. **Confirm:** `ConfirmUpload::run($upload, $file = null)`.
   - On a bucket it checks the size, then reads only the first 256 KB to check the type and record the width and height. On a local disk it hashes the file. A multipart body is hashed and checked before it is written.
   - A mismatch deletes the object (unless a ready record shares it), leaves the record pending and throws `media.upload.mismatch`. An absent object throws `media.upload.missing`.
   - Confirming a ready record returns it unchanged.

Then `AttachUpload::run($upload, $owner, 'slides')` makes the upload a Media item over the existing key. It writes a metadata row only, with no byte copy. Attaching the same upload to the same owner and collection again returns the first item.

## Sharing and deletion

The same content can back several Media items, across owners. **Deleting a Media item over a key never deletes the object.** `KeptFileRemover` removes only that item's own conversions. Only the app's own reference-counted pruner deletes objects, and only once no ready upload or Media item refers to them. The pruner is also the place to clear pending records past their TTL.

## Coverage

`composer test:media-uploads` covers the operations against a temporary local disk and a stubbed presigner. It runs with no network and no real S3. What S3 itself enforces (checksum and length refusal) is not exercised. The BulkDrop `direct` mode and the HTTP routes are not part of this slice.
